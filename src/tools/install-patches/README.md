# Patch whatever we need to fix

Plink comes with not only mono/multi repo management but also other functionalities extend by extensions, I constantly face with all kinds of bugs or weird problems from 3rd-party library, not all of them are easy to fix and contribute back to original open-source repo, the simplest way is,
  I found one problem, I figured out a workaround by updating certain files for problematic library, I create a updated file to replace installed 3rd-party one.

This package is for this purpose, **fixing** and **overwriting** after 3rd-party library installation.
