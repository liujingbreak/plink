# Some useful algorithms or data structure that @whf/plink and @wfh/reactivizer uses

- **Depth-first search** (DFS) and **Breadth-first search** (BFS) graph

- Extensible **Red-black Tree**
    Which supports additional element **Ranking** features:
    - dertermine order statistic for a dynamic set in O(lg n) time.
    and you may augment this tree structure by overriding `left/right rotation` function,
    `fixup` function.

- Interval search tree
    Which support overlapping or duplicate boundary elements.

- `getMinAndMax()` provides a function to find both minimum and maximum value from an iterable by only `O(3n/2)` times comparisons.
